"""Multi-RLM fan-out orchestrator for deep research.

Decomposes a query into orthogonal dimensions, runs parallel RLM instances
per dimension, synthesizes, detects gaps, and verifies.

Architecture:
    Phase 1: Decompose query -> N dimensions (Sonnet, ~30s)
    Phase 2: N parallel RLM runs, one per dimension (~8-15 min wall time)
    Phase 3: Synthesize per-dimension findings (Sonnet, ~30s)
    Phase 4: Gap detection + targeted follow-up RLMs (~5-10 min)
    Phase 5: Verification pass (Haiku, ~30s)
    Phase 6: Final report assembly

Usage:
    RLM_API_BASE=... python -m sagaflow.rlm.orchestrator \
        --query "<seed prompt>" \
        --run-dir /tmp/rlm-deep-test

The seed prompt should include any tenant-specific context the runners need
(repo hosts, docs hosts, email domains, chat platforms, naming conventions).
The workflow itself is tenant-agnostic — it does not embed any specific
hostname, domain, or product name.

    prompt = f"""Generate {n_dirs} research DIRECTIONS for parallel investigation. Each direction is a SHARP enumerative question, not a thematic topic area.

QUERY: {query}

DIMENSIONS — distribute directions across these (WHO/WHAT/HOW/WHERE/WHEN/WHY/LIMITS):
- WHO — which teams/orgs/individuals are involved, who owns, who uses, who decided
- WHAT — which specific systems/services/repos/artifacts exist, what is in scope
- HOW — how to enumerate/discover/measure/verify; concrete tool/query patterns
- WHERE — which infrastructure/region/namespace/cluster/path; deployment locus
- WHEN — timeline; adoption order; migration dates; version cutovers
- WHY — driving requirements; design decisions; alternatives considered
- LIMITS — scale, criticality, classifications; what is OUT of scope

REQUIRED cross-cutting dimensions — include at least ONE direction for EACH:
- PRIOR-FAILURE — who evaluated and abandoned; what didn't work; rollbacks
- BASELINE — authoritative registries; canonical lists; allocation sheets
- ADJACENT-EFFORTS — overlapping/competing/coexisting systems and their boundaries
- STRATEGIC-TIMING — decisions accelerating/blocking adoption right now
- ACTUAL-USAGE — production traffic; active workers; dormant vs alive
- COST-ECONOMICS — annual spend, $/unit, GPU/compute cost, fleet utilization,
  waste, savings opportunities; search internal cost dashboards, budget docs,
  SLT review decks. Without this dim the report skips quantitative cost claims
  that are usually the load-bearing argument for any infra investment proposal.
- INDUSTRY-CONTEXT — public/external comparisons: how peers at FAANG/big-tech
  approach the same problem; what open-source projects exist; canonical
  benchmarks. Skip ONLY if the question is strictly tenant-internal with no
  externally-comparable shape.

BALANCE: distribute directions evenly. No single dimension > {per_dim_cap} directions.

DIVERSITY: each direction must explore a DISTINCT sub-topic. Two directions that
would lead a researcher to the same sources or findings should be merged.

ENUMERATIVE PHRASING — REQUIRED for WHO/WHAT directions specifically. Bad:
"What consumers use the subject?" (too vague). Good: "Which named consumers
import or depend on the subject in production, with named owners per consumer?"
Bad: "What artifacts depend on the subject?" (too vague). Good: "Enumerate
every repository, dataset, service, or named artifact that depends on the
subject, grouped by owner." Phrase every WHO/WHAT direction so its answer is
a LIST of named entities, not a paragraph of generic description.

For each direction:
1. name: short slug for the on-disk directory (lowercase, no spaces, ≤40 chars,
   distinct across all directions in this batch)
2. query: the SELF-CONTAINED enumerative research question (include the original
   topic context — the researcher sees only this query)
3. search_strategy: concrete tools and query angles, 2-3 sentences. Available
   tools are advertised at runner-spawn time; describe ANGLES (e.g. "search the
   codebase for imports of <subject>'s canonical package", "search docs for
   ownership/onboarding/registry pages mentioning <subject>", "search chat for
   announcement messages by the team that owns <subject>") rather than
   prescribing concrete tool names — the runner picks the tool.

Respond in this EXACT JSON format (no other text):
[
  {{
    "name": "who-imports",
    "query": "[WHO] Which named consumers import or depend on <subject> in production, with named owners per consumer?",
    "search_strategy": "Code search for canonical-package imports across all repos; cross-reference with ownership/app-metadata registries; chat pinned messages and onboarding announcements for adoption events."
  }}
]

RULES:
- Generate {n_dirs} directions. Each must be independently researchable.
- Include the original topic context in EVERY query (researcher sees only their own).
- Prefix every query with its dimension tag in brackets — `[WHO]`, `[WHAT]`,
  `[HOW]`, `[WHERE]`, `[WHEN]`, `[WHY]`, `[LIMITS]`, `[PRIOR-FAILURE]`,
  `[BASELINE]`, `[ADJACENT-EFFORTS]`, `[STRATEGIC-TIMING]`, `[ACTUAL-USAGE]`,
  `[COST-ECONOMICS]`, `[INDUSTRY-CONTEXT]`.
- Each direction's `name` is the directory slug — must be unique within the run.
- Do NOT hardcode tenant- or topic-specific tool names (e.g. specific repo
  hostnames, specific docs hosts, specific chat platforms) into queries or
  search strategies — the runner discovers and selects from the tools
  available in its sandbox."""

ORIGINAL QUERY: {query}

FINDINGS FROM EACH DIMENSION:
{findings_text}

MERGED EMAIL ROSTER (deterministic, cross-dim union of every team-contact email surfaced):
{merged_inventory}

TASKS:
1. Produce a unified, comprehensive research report that INTEGRATES findings across dimensions
2. Resolve contradictions (note which source is more authoritative)
3. Cross-reference: when dimension A mentions something dimension B explored in detail, merge the information
4. Identify GAPS — important aspects that NO dimension covered well

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Write the synthesized report in markdown (## sections, specific facts with evidence).

Then output a JSON block identifying gaps:
```json
{{"gaps": [
  {{"name": "gap-name", "query": "focused research question to fill this gap", "search_strategy": "how to search for this"}}
]}}
```

If no significant gaps remain, output: {{"gaps": []}}

QUALITY RULES:
- Every claim must trace back to which dimension found it
- Contradictions must be flagged and resolved with reasoning
- INTEGRATE, don't concatenate — the report should be thematic, not dimension-by-dimension
- Preserve specifics: names, IDs, namespaces, team names, dates, versions
- LENGTH IS UNCAPPED. Do not pre-budget word count or "be concise to save space".
  The right length is whatever it takes to thread every load-bearing claim to a
  citation from the dimension findings below. If that takes 8000 words, write
  8000 words. If it takes 15000, write 15000. The pipeline streams output and
  has no max-tokens ceiling that should constrain you. Under-citing to fit an
  imagined budget is the failure mode being defended against.

REQUIRED ENUMERATION TABLES (defends against narrative-selectivity citation drop):
Prose paragraphs naturally limit how many distinct entities you can mention —
the writer's instinct is to introduce 3-7 examples per topic and skip the rest.
For research questions that ask about MANY named entities (teams, repos,
services, namespaces, datasets, integrations, consumers), this drops 60-80% of
the surfaced identifiers and produces an under-cited report.

DEFEAT THIS by emitting **markdown enumeration tables** for entity-heavy
sections. Whenever the research surfaces more than ~10 named entities of the
same kind, the report MUST include a table that lists ALL of them — not a
narrative paragraph that names 5 and trails off with "and others." Table
structure:

For an "adopters/consumers/teams" question, the table should have columns:
| Owner / Team email | Service or repo (linked) | Identifier (namespace/cluster/job ID) | Use case (one line) | Status |

Every distinct team contact email found in any dimension's citation index
(below) MUST appear as a row in this table, even if you have only a one-line
description from the trajectory. Missing the team_email floor (≥40) because
"the narrative didn't fit it" is exactly the failure being defended against —
the table is the floor's enforcement mechanism. If a pool entry has thin
context, write `Unspecified` in the description column rather than dropping
the row.

For consumer-repo questions, similar tables with columns suited to the
question (repo / owner / namespace / language / branch / status, etc.).

Place the enumeration table(s) in a top-level section called "Inventory" or
similar; the rest of the report can then reference rows by name without
losing the long-tail entities.

CITATION RULES (load-bearing — uncited claims read as hallucination):

The dimension findings below contain a high citation density (typically 10-30
URLs/IDs per dimension across internal docs, repo paths, code-search file URLs,
Slack channels, namespace IDs, and team emails). Selecting only ~20% of these
for the final report — which is what happens by default — produces a report
that LOOKS thorough but cites <30% of the source material. That is itself a
quality failure: it strips the report's verifiability and discards the
research's most valuable artifact.

CITATION DENSITY TARGETS (these are HARD FLOORS, not ceilings):
The "### Citation index" section appended to each dimension above contains
a deterministically-extracted list of every URL, email, channel ID, and
namespace identifier that the dimension's research surfaced. The index is
the ground truth — your report's citations must be drawn from it.

You will be evaluated on whether your report cites the following MINIMUM
counts of distinct identifiers (these floors are designed to make you cite
MORE than your default selectivity instinct allows):

- Total inline markdown links `[label](url)`: aim for **≥250**, NOT 50.
  A report with under 130 links has under-cited badly.
- Code-search URLs cited: **≥120 distinct**. Walk every code-search URL
  in every dimension's citation index and inline-link it next to
  whatever implementation claim it backs. If a code-search URL is in the
  index but you didn't cite it, you're under-citing — find a place to
  anchor it (the file at that URL is a load-bearing source, otherwise
  the research wouldn't have surfaced it). Do NOT pre-filter as "noisy"
  references; the dimension already filtered when it surfaced them.
- Repo paths cited: **≥150 distinct `<org>/<repo>` paths**. Every named
  service, library, fork, or PR mentioned must be hyperlinked to its
  repo URL.
- Team contact emails: **≥40 distinct emails**. When ANY team is named —
  even in passing — link the contact email inline as
  `[<team-name>](mailto:<team>@<domain>)`. The citation index may
  include auto-generated mailing-list patterns; INCLUDE THOSE TOO when
  they appear next to a discussion of who reports to whom or which org
  owns what. Do not pre-filter as "auto-generated"; the cit_index already
  includes them because the research surfaced them as actual evidence.
- Chat-channel identifiers / permalinks: **≥10 distinct channels** with
  code-formatted IDs or markdown permalinks.
- Internal-docs URLs: **≥60 distinct doc URLs** in whatever URL form the
  tenant's docs tool returns.
- System-tagged identifiers (any system-specific instance/scope IDs the
  research surfaced — namespace IDs, account numbers, cluster names,
  region codes, job IDs, etc.): **≥40 distinct identifiers** as
  code-formatted strings.
- Specific dates: **≥15 distinct dated events** (YYYY-MM-DD or "Month YYYY"
  form). Every milestone, incident, GA/Beta release, migration, and
  policy decision MUST carry its specific date inline. The dim findings
  + trajectory have hundreds of dates; cite the load-bearing ones rather
  than abstracting to "in early 2025" / "recently."
- Version identifiers: **≥5 distinct version strings** (SDK versions,
  API versions, semver, dependency versions). When the research
  references a named library/SDK without a version, the pool typically
  has the version from a manifest file or release log; thread the
  specific version inline. Cite the load-bearing ones (cited SDKs,
  blocking-version-of bugs, current-deployed versions).

HOW TO CITE:
- Each dimension's `### Citation index` section is a verbatim, capped list
  of identifiers extracted from BOTH that dimension's raw findings AND its
  runner tool-call trajectory. Use these AGGRESSIVELY. After drafting each
  section of the report, REVIEW the citation indexes for the dimensions
  that informed that section and verify every identifier in those indexes
  has been cited somewhere in the section — if not, you're dropping
  research that the dimension already vetted.
- Inline as `[label](url)`, never as a trailing references section.
- Direct quotes MUST keep their quotation marks AND link the source doc.
- For repo paths and team emails, mailto/repo links are valid: e.g.
  `[`<repo-name>`](https://<repo-host>/<org>/<repo>)`.
- For raw identifiers without a URL (chat-channel IDs, namespace strings,
  bare `<org>/<repo>` paths), use code-formatted strings next to the claim.
- If a claim has no traceable source identifier, mark `(unsourced)` rather
  than presenting it as fact.

THE FAILURE MODE BEING DEFENDED AGAINST: synthesis at this layer naturally
selects "representative" URLs and drops the rest as noise. That selection
is the bug — the dimension layer has already done that filtering by
deciding which URLs to surface in its findings + trajectory. Your job is
to thread EVERY surfaced identifier into the report as a citation, not to
re-curate. UNDER-CITATION IS WORSE THAN OVER-CITATION. A report with 300
inline links is fine; a report with 100 has dropped most of the research."""

    # Use the default 32K safety valve — synthesis decides its own length
    # based on the citation count it needs to emit. Setting an explicit lower

TASKS — focus on internal consistency and unsourced claims, NOT external
falsifiability:

1. Find any internal contradictions (claim X in section A vs claim ¬X in
   section B). List them with line/section references.
2. Find any specific claims (numbers, dates, names, version IDs) that lack
   an inline citation OR are not traceable to an obvious source. List up to 10.
3. Find any places where the report makes a generic LLM-knowledge claim
   (something a model would say about the topic generally, not something
   specific to the operating organization's research) presented as if it
   were primary research.
4. Note structural problems: contradictions between dimensions, missing
   sections, or claims that compound suspiciously (e.g. exact dollar
   amounts, exact incident durations, exact use-case counts).

DO NOT flag any URL/channel/identifier as unverifiable solely on the grounds
that it is internal-only — that is the expected shape of internal research.
The programmatic audit above handles URL existence.
